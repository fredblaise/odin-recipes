    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Oil (for deep-frying)</li>
        <li>Salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and peel potatoes. Cut them into thin strips about 1/4 inch wide. </li>
        <li>Soak the potato strips in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove some of the starch and help them crisp up better when cooked. </li>
        <li>Preheat oil in a deep-fryer or large pot to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Carefully add the potato strips to the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry for 3–5 minutes or until golden and crispy. </li>
        <li>Remove from oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with salt (optional) and serve hot with desired accompaniments.</li>
    </ol>
